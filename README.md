# Other cool css for misago

`status.css`: If available, it displays green for online and red for offline status in posts (all languages).

`smooth.css`: You can set round or square avatars with this pre-written CSS.

`branding.css`: It colors the footer and adds a blue heart to it.

`animation.css`: When hovering over the profile picture, it rotates to the right, and returns to its original state when the mouse is removed, and new thread button rotate when hovering *(I do not recommend using it)*
